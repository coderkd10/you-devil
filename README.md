# You-Devil

React app to see yourself in the devil look ðŸ‘»!  
(Can also take photo to share with friends).

## Demo

You can also try out the [live demo](https://coderkd10.github.io/you-devil/).

## How it works ?

We simply take video from the webcam and apply an inversion filter on it.  

### TODO

In the future I'll try out more advanced filters (implemented in WebAssembly possibly) to give a more SnapChat like feel. Probably will add some devil horns etc.

Some short term todos - 

- Run `eslint` with `--fix`.
- Handle case of no `getUserMedia`.
- Layout is broken on phone.
- Add error boundary.
